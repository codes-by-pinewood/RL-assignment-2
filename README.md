## Reinforcement Learning for CartPole
This repository consists of a comprehensive analysis of the implementation of DQN (Deep Q learning Network) on the CartPole environment. Our analysis consists of two significant parts: a hyperparameter tuning and an ablation study. 


### Dependencies
- Python 3.x
- OpenAI Gym
- Pytorch 
- NumPy


### Installation
- Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/codes-by-pinewood/RL-assignment-2
- Install the relevant dependencies


### Repositories
#### Hyper-Parameter Tuning 
- The dqn_and_dqn_er_comp.ipynb file contains a comparison of the DQN neural Network with DQN neural network without a replay buffer.
